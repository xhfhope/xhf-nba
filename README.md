# xhf-nba

Quick py3 script written to display stats of nba games for the 2016-2017 season. All games and URLs were retrieved using automation and are stored in a .db file (created using pickle). The statistics are then pulled off the mobile nba website using the BeautifulSoup4 module.

I chose to bind this application to a keyboard shortcut for a quick method to take a peek at interesting games.
